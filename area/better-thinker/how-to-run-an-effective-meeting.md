* Four components:
  * Why / context;
  * Output: what must be addressed or answered? and when it is, the meeting concludes;
  * Set boundaries: what is out of scope, i.e., not relevant to the why, and will not be discussed in this meeting;
  * Driver: they introduce the why, they enforce the boundaries, and they get us to the output;
* If for a meeting, context is vague or inviting just stream of consciousness and the driver doesn't enforce boundaries then we can't be surprised of hijacking and confusion is often the result.
