* Target audience - narrowest relevant set of users
* Problem you're solving - specific challenge solved for users
* Value proposition - a clear value statement for users
* Strategic differentiation - what makes it better than competitors
* Channel strategy - how to attract your target audience
* Monetization strategy - how you monetize your audience

For a product strategy to be any good, not only need to articulate your view on each dimension, it also:
* Compelling - have conviction that each dimension will work
* Coherent - Each of the dimensions needs to aligns well with each of the other dimensions, e.g., a freemium monetization strategy is misaligned with a small target audience since freemium only works with a very large target audience to monetize.
