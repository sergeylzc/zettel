* This is the why and it should be stated clearly (not eassy)
* Questions to ask for the problem:
  * Do you experience the problem yourself? This is some indication that this problem exists
  * Can you define the problem narrowly? Who is the first group of users you can address the problem first? You need to get some first indication of PMF.
  * Is the problem solvable?
