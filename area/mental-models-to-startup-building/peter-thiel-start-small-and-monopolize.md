* Every startup should start with a very small market because it's easier to dominate a small market than a large one: 
  * You are small at the beginning hence lacking competitiveness. 
* Small doesn't mean nonexistent; 
* The perfect target market is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors: 
  * A large market will either lack a good starting point or it will be open to competition.
