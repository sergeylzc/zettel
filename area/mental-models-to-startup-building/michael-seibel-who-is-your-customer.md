* Can't understand what problem you are solving until knowing who you are solving it for; 
* Start with a niche market. You are going to be lost because you don't know who you should talk to: 
  * Frequency - How often do they have the problem? 
  * How intense is the problem? 
  * Are they willing to pay? Almost better to start by charging money up front. This is a good way to prove PMF; 
  * How easy are they to find? Don't expect them to find you.
