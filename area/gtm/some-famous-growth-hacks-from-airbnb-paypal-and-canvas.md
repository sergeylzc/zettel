* Airbnb wrote a script to automatically post each new listing to Craigslist bringing them loads of free qualified renters.
* PayPal wrote a script to message eBay sellers, pretending to be a buyer, to ask if they would accept payments via PayPal. Sellers thought their buyers wanted PayPal, so they quickly added the payment option.
