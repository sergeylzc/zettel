Or more broadly what to work on? Define your traction goal and critical Path to guide you.

### Defining your traction goal
* Given all the different opportunities/product or service revisions/tasks pulling you in a lot of different directions
* Always should have an explicit traction goal you're working toward, e.g., one thousand paying customers, one hundred new daily customers, or 10 percent of your market
* Once that is defined, you can work backward and set clear quantitative and time-based traction subgoals, such as reaching one thousand customers by next quarter or hitting 20 percent monthly growth targets. Clear subgoals provide accountability

### Defining your critical path
* The path to reaching your traction goal with the fewest number of steps is your Critical Path
* You should literally enumerate the intermediate steps (milestones) to get your traction goal
* These milestones need not be traction related, but they should be absolutely necessary to reach your goal
  * Milestones could be
    * Hiring these people
    * Adding features A, B and C to your product
    * Engaging in marketing activities X, Y, Z
  * DuckDuckGo as an example
    * Intial traction goal was to get to 100 million searches a month. The team believed the milestones they needed to hit included a faster site, a more compellig mobile offering, and more broadcast TV coverage (from publicity traction channel). Some product features like images and auto-suggest were continually requested, they believed they were not absolutely necessary milstones in their Critical Path to reach that traction goal
    * But when the traction goal changed to 1 percent of the overall search market, those features are needed because now they had to get new users and those new users won't be that forgiving
  * The milestones will be different for you. The point is to be critical and strategic in deciding what to include. That's why it's called the Critical Path
* Be critical to your milestones
  * Stay on the critical path: limited resources hence can't afford to waste
  * Reevaluating the critical path: some milestones might no longer needed as you've finished a milestone
