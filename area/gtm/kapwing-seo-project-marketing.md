  * Host them on your own domain;
  * Get them in front of the press.

  * Direct outreach to journalists / bloggers who work in their niche;
  * Utilize Product Hunt since journalists browse Product Hunt for article inspiration.
* e.g., Cartoonify:
    * In 2018, a polaroid camera was getting attention for being able to turn photos into cartoon drawings;
    * They found the open-sourced code and turned it into a simple web app;
    * Then they started emailing all the journalists **who wrote about the original, sharing their web-app version**;
    * Their reward was 100+ new backlinks.
