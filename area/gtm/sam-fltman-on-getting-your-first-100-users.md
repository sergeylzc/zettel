* Use your network. Email/call in favors from everyone you know. If it's a paid product, charge them. It's a good way to validate your product
* Research people who might use your product and reach out to them asking to try. "Conversion rates are low — maybe 2-3% — so youll have to reach out to more people"
* Social media outreach, posting to HN, forums, PR, etc. "The important thing to look for here is a traffic source that is sustainable rather than one big pop that then promptly goes away"
* Buy ads and point them at your website. "This is the 'laziest' and least impressive thing you can do"
