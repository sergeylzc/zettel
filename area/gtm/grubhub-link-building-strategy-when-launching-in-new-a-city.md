* In 2007, Grubhub raised $1.1 million and time to expand to New York;
* Every day, thousands of Americans search for food delivery on Google so ranking on top would mean high intentional traffic;
* SEO is the key growth channel and to rank high they needed backlinks;
* The strategy was to offer incentive to local press:
  * Grubhub would go to local press and offer to give their readers $10 off their first order;
  * All the local press had to do was link to the new city's page which explained the discount;
  * After a while, the new city's page would build enough local links and it would rank 1st;
  * The "link juice" then flowed downstream to each city's specific food pages, helping them climb the search results.
* For every new market to enter after, Grubhub replicated the process again.
