1. Who is your target customer? Identify your target customer by understanding:
  * What your product does; 
  * What problem is solves; 
  * Who wants this problem solved. 
2. Where do they hang out? To find out where your target audience hangs out:
  * Create a master list of potential places; 
  * Establish criteria for what a solid marketing channel (<a href="https://www.littletunnel.com/reference/F33CA490/" data-note-url="/reference/F33CA490/">KISSmetric's</a>); 
  * Vet your list according to those criteria; 
3. How do you engage with them? To engage with your customer:
  * Identify your method of engagement, e.g., using twitter hashtags; 
  * Expand as far as this method allows, e.g., dominating relavent hashtags; 
  * Confine your reach only to the target audience; 
  * Aim to deliver a high amount of value, e.g., share great content from other marketer.
