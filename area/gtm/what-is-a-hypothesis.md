* A basic hypothesis has two parts: what we believe, and the evidence we're seeking to know if we're right or wrong;
* A simple hypothesis might look like this:
  * We believe that if people share pictures of our t-shirts at a greater rate, it will prompt existing customers to return to our site at a greater rate;
    * To present what you believe, you need to show some evidence. Can't just be gut feeling.
  * We'll know we're right when we see a correlation between social shares and return visits.
