* Attention: make the buyer aware of a problem they have
* Interest: the buyer becomes interested in solving their problem
* Desire: the buyer becomes interested in your solution to their problem
* Action: the buyer acquires your solution

e.g., [Swiffer's ad](https://youtu.be/nIlkB-0qW6A):
* Attention: Traditional cleaning methods stir up dirt
* Interest: Dirt needs to be removed, not just moved
* Desire: Swiffer cloths collect dirt and can be thrown away
* Action: Find Swiffer in the household cleaning aisle
