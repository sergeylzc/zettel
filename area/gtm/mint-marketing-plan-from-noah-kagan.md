* Mint.com grew to over 100,000 registered users within 6 months of launch from **a prelaunch list of 1000 registered users 3 months before launch**; 
* The secret is their Quant-based marketing framework called The Mint Marketing Playbook: 
  * It's a framework for acquiring customers and promoting your business as defined by two main features: 
    * A specific, quantitative top-line goal that says what and by when: 
      * Instead of staring at a single enormous goal, the entrepreneur can view the top-line goal as an aggregation of many smaller goals, that can be rearranged, magnified, or dialed back in order to optimize for X result in Y timeframe. 
    * Eliminate hope by naming, measuring and reacting to every feeder channel: 
      * Quant-based marketing demands that you break down your marketing strategy into multiple tactics, your "feeder channels," that are all discrete, measurable, and easily magnified or minimized. 
  * It has 5 steps:
    * Establish specific goals; 
    * Make your target list prior to launch; 
    * Find where your users are online; 
    * Test messaging; 
    * Track everything.
