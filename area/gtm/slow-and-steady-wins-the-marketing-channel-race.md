## Build Your Marketing Channel Like You Build a Product
* Product team operates with a series of iterations, cycles, and feedback. Same for a marketing channel; 
* Main difference is the feedback loop; 
* The main feedback you’re looking for is whether your leads are converting, clicking, or completing desired actions based on your campaign efforts; 
* Need tons of cycles to get everything right to build a marketing channel. 

## Narrow Your Focus and Set Your Goals Realistically
* To master a marketing channel, **work on one at a time**: 
  1. Choose one marketing channel; 
  2. Choose one campaign or campaign type within that channel; 
  3. Then, allow the campaign to meet its goals. 
* You do this until certain criteria (determine based on your business needs) are met. 

## Data Collection
* Data collection should always remain your guiding light as you build your channel; 
* Good quality data will be your currency as you navigate campaigns and channel mastery; 
  * **Marketing data can be imprecise, but it will ultimately prove to be directionally correct**. 
* So be sure that you trust your data and collect the right kind to help your case. 

## Embarking on a hypothesis-driven approach
* Someone has an idea for a campaign. The right questions to ask:
  * ls it clearly thought out how this campaign will work - mechanism, time limits, budget limits, expertise on team or vendor, and who knows what else? 
  * ls it clear what **the minimum result** is to declare this (somewhat) successful - are there actuals from other campaigns to compare to? 
  * ls the team/vendor actually equipped to run this campaign as needed to achieve and measure that initial result? 
  * Has anyone not involved in setting up the campaign played “devil's advocate”? 
  * Are you able to capture the data to make the assessment of the campaign'ssuccess? 

## Concentric circles of channel experimentation
* Once the campaign passes the examination, try it out with the concentric circles of channel experimentation approach: 
  1. The Pilot; 
  2. Repeat & Enlarge Pilot; 
  3. Real Money Spend; 
  4. The Ceiling. 
* This second step is necessary to ensure success is repeatable, scalable, and dependable.
