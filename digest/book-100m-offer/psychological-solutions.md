- Most people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions, which usually have been tried
- If you try to solve a problem with logic, what comes out of it usually is a undifferentiated solution
- If you want to charge for a premium, you need to come up with psychological solutions
- Some examples:
    - Commuter complain about trains being too slow
        - Logical solution: make trains faster to increase satisfaction
        - Psychological solution: decrease the pain of waiting by adding a dotted map
        - Psychological solution: pay models to be the hostesses on the trip (people would wish it took longer to get to their destination!)
    - Elevator is too slow
        - Logical solution: make elevator faster
        - Psychological solution: add floor to ceiling mirrors so people are distracted staring at themselves and forget how long they were on the elevator
    - How do we increase sales?
        - Logical solution: make it cheaper‚Äù
