- As a company, you have to grow or die. You can't stand still if every around you is growing.
- So what does it take to grow?
  - Get more customers
  - Increase their average purchase value
  - Get them to buy more times
- Terms to calculate growth:
  - Gross profit: revenue made from an additional customer minus direct costs of fulfillment
  - Net profit: what's left over after all expenses are paid
  - Lifetime value: gross profit accrued over the entire lifetime of a customer
